# 📘 C Programming Language

C is one of the most powerful and foundational programming languages ever created. It provides low-level control, efficient memory management, and a deep understanding of how computers actually work. Learning C helps you build a strong base for mastering advanced languages, data structures, algorithms, operating systems, embedded systems, and more.

This repository is designed as a **day-by-day learning path**, starting from the absolute basics and gradually moving toward advanced topics. Each concept is explained in a structured, beginner-friendly way so that any learner can follow along without difficulty.
